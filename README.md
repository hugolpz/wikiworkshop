# wikiworkshop
Tool to generate list of changes to be made on wikipedia, based on common mistakes.

To use it : 
- copy the files to a server running php
- update the config.json file with errors you want to search for (```ko``` key is for the mispelled word, ```ok``` for the correct one)
- change ```index.php``` where there are two mentions of fr.wikipedia.org by the code of the wikipedia you want to deal with;
